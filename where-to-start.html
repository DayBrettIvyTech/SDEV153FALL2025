    <h1>If you’re new to these albums, here are some great entry points across different styles:</h1>
  
    <ul class="starter-list">
      <li>
        <p><strong>Fleet Foxes – Live on Boston Harbor</strong>: A fantastic live album consisting of songs from all of their discography. This gives you a good introduction to not only Fleet Foxes, but also to how good they sound live. <em>(I have seen live them 4 times, and they rocked the house all 4 times.)</em></p>
        <p>Recommended songs: <em>Mykonos, Blue Spotted Tail, Ragged Wood,</em> and <em>Montezuma.</em></p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Aphex Twin – Selected Ambient Works 85–92</strong>: If you've never listened to electronic music (not including EDM), then this album would be a good starting point. This album is warm, bass-heavy, and endlessly listenable, a true modern classic.</p>
        <p>Recommended songs: <em>Xtal, Tha, Pulsedwidth,</em> and <em>Ptolemy.</em> </p>
        <img src="Cover Artwork/selected.png" alt="Aphex Twin SAW 85–92 cover">
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Playboi Carti - Whole Lotta Red</strong>: Is a visceral, fast-paced, bass-heavy, 24-track-long shotgun blast to the conscience that combines Atlanta-style trap, IDM, hardcore, punk, and death-metal. This album exists within it's own genre entirely, and was a complete stylistic departure from his previous album, <em>Die Lit.</em></p>
        <p>Whole Lotta Red singlehandedly altered the trajectory of Playboi Carti's career, and changed modern hip-hop forever. Furthermore, Carti's eccentric live performances during this time have been replicated by no one. Since this album came out, I've listened to it daily, and it keeps getting better.</p>
        <p>Recommended songs: <em>Stop Breathing, Slay3r, New Tank, No Sl33p,</em> and <em>ILoveUIHateU.</em></p>
        <img src="Cover Artwork/red.jpg" alt="Bob Dylan Blonde on Blonde cover">
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>John Maus - We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves</strong>: Is a cryptic foray into the world of underground darkwave, synthpop, and something else stranger entirely. Maus barks undetermined lyrics over driving synth lines, creating an atmosphere plucked from a dusty box of 80's VHS tapes. 
        <p>The album's power lies in its paradox: simultaneously absurd, yet deadly serious. Maus pushes lyricism to the edge of parody, then brings you back to earth with odd lines such as <em>"This is where the human being finds itself in a locker (Head for the Country)."</em> Maus's background as a PhD recipient influences the lyricism greatly. His live performance style is no less paradoxical. Maus takes the stage, presses 'play' on his songs, and then thrashes about the stage screaming, drenching himself with endless water bottles. It's this intense performance style which influences the perception of the music, and creates an even stranger context for an already perplexing project. </p>
        <p>This is less of a musical project, and more of a haunted manifesto born from the Upper Midwest. It's a singular experience, and has not been replicated by Maus himself or anybody else, for that matter. </p>
        <p>Recommended songs: <em>Matter of Fact, Head for the Country, Cop Killer,</em> and <em>The Crucifix</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>Kendrick Lamar – Good Kid, m.A.A.d City</strong>: A modern classic in hip-hop storytelling.</p>
