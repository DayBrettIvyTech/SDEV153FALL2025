    <p>
      Some of the artists featured on this website have serious personal controversies or troubling histories.
      By including their work here, I am not endorsing the personal conduct of the artist, I’m simply acknowledging their musical contributions weighed against my own personal politics and convictions. 

    <h3>Kanye West (a.k.a. “Ye”)</h3>
    <p>
      In 2022, Kanye West appeared on Alex Jones’s show and expressed praise for Adolf Hitler, among other statements. In the days after the interview,
      there was no shortage of vitriolic hate speech from West. His subsequent album (<em>Vultures</em>) was promoted with a logo that bore
      a striking resemblance to the <em>Reichsadler</em> (an eagle emblem clutching a swastika, used in Nazi Germany). To be clear: I stand with the Jewish community and do not condone hate speech of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The album I list here is West’s 2013 release Yeezus, an poignant commentary on modern America. It touches on for-profit prisons,
      overconsumption of luxury goods, and the emptiness and decadence of public life. It’s also masterfully produced (Rick Rubin, Justin Vernon, Daft Punk, among others).
      <em>Yeezus</em> remains a landmark work despite the creator’s later statements. The artist who made Yeezus is not the same person who later went on Alex Jones’s show. 
    </p>

    <h3>Burzum (Varg Vikernes)</h3>
    <p>Varg Vikernes is a convicted murderer, and arsonist. He spent 15 years in prison for the murder of his bandmate, Øystein Aarseth. Vikernes is among the most reprehensible figures in modern music history.</p>
    <p>I struggle to separate art from artist, especially when the artist is particularly awful. I of course do not share any of the political views of Varg Vikernes, and I think the man should be in prison.</p>
    <p>The album listed here is <em>Filosofem</em>, undeniably a landmark work in Scandinavian Black metal. This album is a solo work, with a distinct, harsh, lo-fi feeling.
      This was done purposefully, to make the album sound as evil as possible. Rumor has it that Vikernes used a Soviet military surplus helicopter headset
      to record the vocals, giving them a distinct hazy feeling. Although Vikernes is incredibly problematic, there is no better album to play in the depths of January than <em>Filosofem.</em></p>

    <h3>Ariel Pink</h3>
    <p>Ariel Pink, compared to the aforementioned artists, is far less problematic, but still problematic enough to warrant a mention on this list.</p>
    <p>Ariel Pink attended the January 6th protests in Washington D.C. He was not one of the insurrectionists, but he was there regardless. After the fact, he went on Tucker Carlson's show to justify his attendance.</p>
    <p>This is more of a "I don't endorse the man's politics" disclaimer, rather than a, "This is an irredeemable human being" disclaimer, as is the case with Kanye West and Varg Vikernes.</p>
    <p>The album listed here is "Pom Pom", which is a light, goofy, unserious synthpop album.</p>
